Squeak Craft One
================
This is an attempt at a mod for the game Minecraft

Currently building for 1.7.10

What is it
----------
Currently it has some blocks to build a massive automation system using pipes and machines.

This is a massive work in progress, if you like what you see then stick around and see what we have planned!

Based in part on Pahimar's LetsModReboot series. (Thank you Pahimar!)
